### Day-0 (08.06.19) : Web Scrapping of text Images and performing Sentimental Analysis on it
Using Request Library text Images are scrapped from website. In order to identify text from Image Python ocr is used which is provided by Tesseract Library then the final sentimental analysis is performed to find whether text present is positive,negative or neutral.

### Day-1 (09.06.19) : HandWritten Digits Recognition Using Sklearn
From Sklearn library dataset for digits are loaded in order to train the Model. Decision Tree Classifier Model is used here in order to identify the digit. Accuracy which comes out after training and testing the model is 85% which seems to be good for prediction. Some handwritten digits are extracted from web in order to identify them using request and pillow library. Finally it perfectly identify the digit.
